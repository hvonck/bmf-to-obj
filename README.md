# bmf-to-obj
This project converts one or multiple Bever Model Format (BMF) files into an obj, fit for 3D printing or other use cases.
If you're not that tech savvy, but you know the unique ID that your scan has, you can use automatic.bat to automatically download and convert a Bever scan on Windows 10.

IMPORTANT:
This is a hobby project that is not meant to harm Bever, Volumental or anyone else.
I created this because I wanted to 3D print a scan taken by them, but none of the models were easily accessible on their website.
